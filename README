DESCRIPTION:
This script takes as input a My Clippings.txt file from a Kindle and allows Notes, Highlights and Bookmarks to be exported in text files separated by title. 

Other formats of output will soon be added including markdown and html. I'm open to suggestions about any other useful formats. 

Also provides classes for working with clippings data that may be useful in other applications.

                        Valid options: text. More options coming soon.


TO DO:
- Simple query support (by date, by title, by author, etc.), to limit output
- Any suggestions? Feel free to contact me or contribute.
