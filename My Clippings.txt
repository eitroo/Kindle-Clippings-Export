This verse introduces the three chief acts of Jewish piety (cf. vv. 2-18)—almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. In each act the logical structure is the same: (1) a warning not to do the act to be praised by human beings, (2) a guarantee that those who ignore this warning will get what they want but no more, (3) instruction on how to perform the act of piety secretly, and (4) the assurance that the Father who sees in secret will reward openly.

in both spheres of righteousness Jesus issues his insistent call to his followers to be different. In Matthew 5 he teaches that our righteousness must be greater than that of the Pharisees (because they obeyed the letter of the law, while our obedience must include our heart) and greater also (in the form of love) than that of the pagans (because they love each other, while our love must include our enemies as well).

C. S. Lewis wisely wrote in an essay entitled ‘The weight of glory’: ‘We must not be troubled by unbelievers when they say that this promise of reward makes the Christian life a mercenary affair. There are different kinds of reward. There is the reward [Sermon on the Mount, Page 132] which has no natural connection with the things you do to earn it, and is quite foreign to the desires that ought to accompany those things. Money is not the natural reward of love; that is why we call a man mercenary if he marries a woman for the sake of her money. But marriage is the proper reward for a real lover, and he is not mercenary for desiring it.’ Similarly we might say that a silver cup is not a very suitable reward for a schoolboy who works hard, whereas a scholarship at the university would be. C. S. Lewis concludes his argument: ‘The proper rewards are not simply tacked on to the activity for which they are given, but are the activity itself in consummation.’1

when we need to seek God for some particular direction or blessing we turn aside from food and other distractions in order to do so. Thus Moses fasted on Mount Sinai immediately after the covenant was renewed by which God had taken Israel to be his people; Jehoshaphat, seeing the armies of Moab and Ammon advancing towards him, ‘set himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah’; Queen Esther, before she took her life in her hands by approaching the king, urged Mordecai to gather the Jews and ‘hold a fast’ on her behalf, while she and her maids did the same; Ezra ‘proclaimed a fast’ before leading the exiles back to Jerusalem, ‘that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from him a straight way’; not least, as already mentioned, our Lord Jesus himself fasted immediately before his public ministry began; and the early church followed his example, the church of Antioch before Paul and Barnabas were sent out on the first missionary journey, and Paul and Barnabas themselves before appointing elders in every new church which they had planted.2 The evidence is plain that special enterprises need special prayer, and that special prayer may well involve fasting.

PART 1: GOD AS SPIRIT 1. When people worship God, how do they relate to him? (John 4:23-24) We worship God in spirit and in truth. There’s a mystery to it, especially since we aren’t relating to God in a physical way. (This doesn’t make it any less personal, though!) 2. Where does God live? (Isaiah 66:1) It seems like “heaven” is a good response. But it’s followed with the fact that no one place could contain God. God is everywhere. 3. What does God look like? (Luke 24:39; 1 Timothy 1:17) God isn’t human (immortal), is unable to be seen (invisible), and, according to John 14, is a Spirit (without flesh and bone). This is why Jesus’ coming to earth was so incredible. 4. How can we best get a picture of God? (John 1:18) Through God’s one and only Son—Jesus Christ. 5. How does God describe himself in Scripture? (Exodus 33:18-23) God says you can’t see him and live. When describing himself to Moses, God mentions his “back” and his “ face.” This is anthropomorphism—a big word your students may have already learned in literature class. It’s the act of assigning human characteristics to nonhuman things as part of a description.

Convertible bonds are always callable. The firm uses the call to force the holders to convert the bonds. Once the bond is called, the owner must convert, or any appreciation in price that has resulted from an increase in the stock’s value will be lost. Such forced conversion is extremely important to the issuing firm, because it no longer has to pay the interest and retire the debt.

If the firm defaults, the bond is reissued as part of a reorganization or the bond becomes worthless.

Another teacher I spoke with, a 58-year-old mother of grown children who has been teaching kindergarten for 17 years, told me she feels that parents are increasingly getting in the way of their children’s development. “I see the way their parents treat them,” she said, “and there’s a big adjustment when they get into my class. It’s good for them to realize that they aren’t the center of the world, that sometimes other people’s feelings matter more than theirs at a particular moment—but it only helps if they’re getting the same limit-setting at home. If not, they become impulsive, because they’re not thinking about anybody else.”
